### Plot the number of Tropical Cyclones between 1842 and 2021 on a map.
This quick plotting exercise of NASA's tropical cyclone count data is intended for students to learn to plot data from a URL (no downloads necessary) using python libraries matplotlib, cartopy, and xarray. It is intended for a lesson on extreme weather and hurricanes with an audience in grade bands 9-12. By plotting the locations of frequent tropical cyclone activity, students will be encouraged to think about why tropical cyclones occur in specific regions on Earth.
